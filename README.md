### DJS06: Higher Order Functions

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of different JavaScript array methods to manipulate and process data. It has operations on two arrays with the first containing names and others containing provinces as well as an array of product object with prices. My code showcase iteration, mapping, filtering, reducing and other array manipulations to achieve specific tasks.

## Concepts and techniques explored

1. Iterating using `forEach()`
2. Mapping Arrays
3. Sorting Arrays
4. Filtering Arrays
5. Using `reduce` for Accumulation
6. Combining Methods

## Learning Approach
I broke down tasks into smaller manageable steps. Each step was implemented using a specific array method and the output was logged to the console to verify correctness. I gained a deeper understanding of their functionalities.
